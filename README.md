I. in **saucedemo.cy.js** I automated the following scenario: logged in into saucedemo website, added 3 items into the shopping cart, removed 1 item and then placed an order for them

II. in **ValidateProductsFiltering.cy.js** I will automate the various product filters.....
Below is my test plan for validating the filtering.
Check that the products are correctly displayed after the following criteria:
  1) in the default order, which is in ascending alphabetical order of their names (A to Z)
  2) in descending alphabetical order of their names (Z to A)
  3) in ascending price order, from low to high
  4) in descending price order, from high to low
